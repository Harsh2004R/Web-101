ðŸ”¥ Problem: "Simple Course Registration App" (Multi-page)
ðŸ’¡ Scenario:
Page 1 (register.html): User fills out a form with their name and a course name.

Page 2 (courses.html): Displays the list of registered users and their selected courses (fetched from localStorage).

Page 3 (details.html): When a user is clicked, shows their detailed info (name + course) based on localStorage.

Youâ€™ll manage saving/fetching data via localStorage across pages.

â”œâ”€â”€ courses.html
â”œâ”€â”€ details.html
â””â”€â”€ app.js (Optional: or use inline scripts per file)



Your Tasks (Logic Side):
 Use localStorage to share data across pages.

 In register.html, store each registration as an object in an array in localStorage.

 In courses.html, read the array and list all users. Clicking one stores their data and redirects to details.html.

 In details.html, fetch and display the clicked user's info.
